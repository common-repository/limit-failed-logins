Limit Login Attempts protects your site from attacks which tries to gain access / login to a site with random usernames and passwords. 

== Description ==
Limit Failed Logins avoids brute-force attacks and improves your site speed by lowering the number of login attempts allowed through the primary login and Woocommerce, XMLRPC, and custom login pages. After a set number of retries has been performed, this plugin will prevent an Internet address (IP) and username from making additional attempts, making a brute-force attempt difficult.

WordPress accepts an infinite number of login attempts by default. Passwords can be easily cracked using brute force as a result of it. Limit Failed Login to prevent your site from attacks that attempt to obtain access/login to your site using random usernames and passwords. Try it out and secure your site from hackers and viruses!
